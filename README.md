# Mental Health Data Analysis and Prediction

This project is part of a Data Science course, where I aim to understand and address mental health issues using data-driven insights. The dataset focuses on various mental health-related factors, enabling a detailed exploration and prediction model to assess mental health conditions.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main phases:

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
A comprehensive analysis of the dataset has been conducted to understand its structure, identify trends, and visualize patterns. This phase involved handling missing data, outliers, and feature engineering to enhance data quality and provide meaningful insights.

### 2. **Machine Learning Model**
Building on the insights from the EDA phase, I developed a machine learning model to predict mental health conditions based on the dataset. The model was trained and tested using various algorithms to ensure accuracy and robustness.

## How to Run the Project
